#Modulo Calculate

The modulo plus calculation (or maybe that's the name I gave it) is a calculation that is taken from the initial value which is Z.
Suppose here I have a value of Z = 4, then to get the desired value we need to increase the value of 1, 2, 3 and 4 to the power of 1 to 4 also according to the existing Z value.
Then the initial value that returns 0 will be the result of this calculation.

1. First I look for the rank value that I ordered in this calculation.

2. After getting the value for the calculation, the second stage I start calculating the value with the value that I set in the initial process.

3. The last stage is to determine the result, I take all the 0 values ​​that I get in the initial calculation from 1 - 4 (according to the z value that I have determined)
